# **Lookouts**

Lookouts review and organize submissions to Code4rena's competitions, focusing on a) lightening and clarifying the project team’s workload, and b) preparing the repo for judging.

Lookouts receive a guaranteed payout from each contest. In the interest of impartiality, they must forgo any awards they would have received for their own submissions as wardens. Therefore, the role is typically assigned prior to the competition's start.

# **Becoming a Lookout**

To become a Lookout, you may be nominated by a Judge or Lookout in good standing, or nominate yourself.

- Be a [Certified C4 contributor](/roles/certified-contributors) in good standing;
- Find at least 1 high severity finding OR 3 medium severity findings OR score A on at least 3 QA or Gas reports;

### **Non-technical criteria**

- **Sense of fairness**—i.e. evidence suggests you don't show favoritism, but instead aim for a fair competition where quality is rewarded.
- **Clear written communication**—your English does not need to be perfect, but you should be able to engage in technical discussions with judges and sponsors via written English.
