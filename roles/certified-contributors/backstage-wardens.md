# +Backstage wardens

Certified contributors who meet certain performance criteria within C4 gain "+Backstage" access to C4 audits, which includes:

- Immediate access to findings repos after audits conclude;
- Contributing to post-audit triage; and
- Post-judging QA.

The minimum criteria to become +Backstage are as follows: 

1. Be approved as a Certified C4 contributor;
1. Submit valid findings to at least 3 Code4rena audits (i.e. valid findings on the [Code4rena leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard/));
1. Have at least 1 high severity finding OR 3 medium severity findings on the [Code4rena leaderboard](https://code4rena.com/leaderboard/), OR score A on a QA report, Gas report, or Analysis (formerly "Advanced Analysis"; basic Analysis grades are not eligible);
1. Abide by the Certified Contributor Terms and Conditions (see [application form](https://code4rena.com/certified-contributor-application/)).

## To request +Backstage access

Once you meet the eligibility criteria, submit a [Help Desk Request](https://code4rena.com/help/) to request +Backstage access, and C4 staff will get you set up.

## Certified contributor professional conduct guidelines

Contributors may lose their +Backstage role by violating the code of professional conduct as outlined in the certified contributor agreement. This code asks wardens to:

- take an objective, collegial, and intellectually open tone in considering and discussing all findings
- treat wardens and sponsors, and all other Code4rena community members with respect and an assumption of positive intent
- avoid engaging in any discussion and evaluation of issues they submitted themselves except to answer a question or provide additional context requested by a judge or sponsor
- treat the contents of all findings as private and confidential until the audit report is made public.
