1. Submit at least 1 high severity finding OR 3 medium severity findings OR score >85 on a QA or Gas report;

## To request +Backstage access

Once you meet the eligibility criteria, submit a [Help Desk Request](https://code4rena.com/help/) to request +Backstage access, and C4 staff will get you set up.

## Certified contributor professional conduct guidelines

Contributors may lose their +Backstage role by violating the code of professional conduct as outlined in the certified contributor agreement. This code asks wardens to:

- take an objective, collegial, and intellectually open tone in considering and discussing all findings
- treat wardens and sponsors with respect and an assumption of positive intent
- avoid engaging in any discussion and evaluation of issues they submitted themselves except to answer a question or provide additional context requested by a judge or sponsor
- treat the contents of all findings as private and confidential until the contest report is made public.
