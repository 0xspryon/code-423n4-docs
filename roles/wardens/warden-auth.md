# Register your account

If you competed in C4 contests prior to October 5, 2022 and have not previously registered your username via wallet authentication, you must register your account.

## Authenticate with your wallet

You can authenticate with your wallet using either MetaMask or WalletConnect and submit findings without re-entering the same info over and over. After you register you can have the option to log in with either your wallet or your username and password.

If you have and existing Code4rena username, you can re-register your warden handle at https://code4rena.com/ by connecting your wallet from the "connect" dropdown.

## Authenticate with username and password

If you're a new warden, you can choose to sign up with a username and password only. **If you choose this option, you won't be able to link a wallet to your account for authentication purposes later.**

## How to connect your wallet and submit findings

- Go to https://code4rena.com/ and hover over the “connect” dropdown.
- Choose whether to connect with MetaMask or WalletConnect, or sign up with just a username and password.
- If you were a registered warden and submitted valid findings before May 25, 2022, you need to connect your wallet. Make sure to connect with an address you’ve used previously to receive earnings from code4rena contests prior to May 25, 2022.
- Follow the prompts to connect your C4 username with your wallet.
- Check your email for further instructions.

## Once your request to connect your wallet is complete and approved:

- Sign in with the same method you used to register.
- Proceed to the contest of your choice and submit a finding as usual.

## Teams

Once individual team members are authenticated, they will be able to submit findings as individuals or on behalf of the team.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### If you were a registered warden prior to June 28, 2022 and you see this error when you fill out the registration form:

`[your handle] is already a registered username`

If you submitted valid findings before May 25, 2022, please choose either MetaMask or WalletConnect from the "connect" dropdown.

1. If you did that and ended up on the registration page, please make sure you connect with a wallet address you’ve used for a Code4rena contest prior to May 25, 2022.
2. If that doesn’t work, please [submit a Help Desk request](https://code4rena.com/help/).

### If your registration was merged but you still can't log in:

Make sure you are authenticating with the same address you used when you registered.

If that doesn’t work, please [submit a Help Desk request](https://code4rena.com/help/).

### If you previously submitted findings, but your wallet is not supported by WalletConnect:

The best solution here is for you to import your wallet to either MetaMask, or another wallet app that is supported by WalletConnect.

If you can’t do that, then you’ll need to use a different wallet that is supported by MetaMask or WalletConnect. Once you have your wallet set up, please [submit a Help Desk request](https://code4rena.com/help/) and C4 staff will help you get your wallet connected with your C4 account.

### **Can I change my wallet address?**

Unfortunately due to some restrictions in Moralis, changing addresses is not currently supported as well as we’d like it to be in the future. There is one exception: if you use MetaMask, you can link multiple addresses to your C4 account.

However, **it’s critical that you do not try to log in with the new address that you want to link before you link it.** Attempting to connect while signed in to the new MetaMask address you want to connect will create a new user object. That new user object will block your ability to associate that address with your C4 account. Please watch the video below for details.

To link multiple addresses in MetaMask, please follow the instructions in this video:

### **But I really, really want to change my wallet!**

If you like, you can register a new account using a new wallet, but it will require registering a separate username, and your leaderboard history will remain with your previous account.

### **What if my wallet was hacked?**

If you are not logged in and you haven't set up your password yet, click "Log in" from the connect dropdown and then click "forgot password" to get a password reset link. Next, log in with your new password and make sure to update your payment addresses from the account page. Then please submit a help request through our [Help Desk](https://code4rena.com/help/) while logged in so that we can remove the hacked wallet from your account.
