# Authenticate with your wallet

## Authenticate with your wallet

You can authenticate with your wallet using either MetaMask or WalletConnect and submit findings without re-entering the same info over and over.

If you have and existing Code4rena username, you can re-register your warden handle at https://code4rena.com/ to associate your wallet address with your C4 warden info.

## How to connect your wallet and submit findings

* Go to https://code4rena.com/ and click the “connect wallet” link
* If you have previously submitted valid findings: use an address you’ve used previously to receive earnings from code4rena contests.
* Follow the prompts to connect your C4 username with your wallet.
* Check your email for further instructions.

## Once your request to connect your wallet is complete and approved:

* Sign in with MetaMask or WalletConnect
* Proceed to the contest of your choice and submit a finding as usual

## Teams

Once individual team members are authenticated, they will be able to submit findings as individuals or on behalf of the team.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### If you can't find your handle in the dropdown on the registration page:

First, please make sure you connect from the "connect wallet" dropdown instead of going straight to the registration page. 

1. If you did that and ended up on the registration page, please make sure you connect with a wallet address you’ve used for a Code4rena contest prior to May 25, 2022. 
2. If that doesn’t work, please [submit a Help Desk request](https://code4rena.com/help/).

### If your registration was merged but you still can't log in:

Registrations are merged in batches, during business hours, so it can take a few hours before your registration is fully merged. 

If your registration has been merged into main *and* the deploy has completed, and you’re still unable to log in, make sure you are authenticating with the same address you used when you registered.

If that doesn’t work, please [submit a Help Desk request](https://code4rena.com/help/).

### If you previously submitted findings, but your wallet is not supported by WalletConnect:

The best solution here is for you to import your wallet to either MetaMask, or another wallet app that is supported by WalletConnect.

If you can’t do that, then you’ll need to use a different wallet that is supported by MetaMask or WalletConnect. Once you have your wallet set up, please [submit a Help Desk request](https://code4rena.com/help/) and C4 staff will help you get your wallet connected with your C4 account.

### **Can I change my wallet address?**

Unfortunately due to some restrictions in Moralis, changing addresses is not currently supported as well as we’d like it to be in the future. There is one exception: if you use MetaMask, you can link multiple addresses to your C4 account.

However, **it’s critical that you do not try to log in with the new address that you want to link before you link it.** Attempting to connect while signed in to the new MetaMask address you want to connect will create a new user object. That new user object will block your ability to associate that address with your C4 account. Please watch the video below for details.

To link multiple addresses in MetaMask, please follow the instructions in this video:

### **But I really, really want to change my wallet!**

If you like, you can register a new account using a new wallet, but it will require registering a separate username, and your leaderboard history will remain with your previous account.

### **What if my wallet was hacked?**

If there is a genuine security risk, please submit a help request through our [Help Desk](https://code4rena.com/help/). We can't guarantee that we can solve it for you, but we'll do our best.
