# Register your account

If you competed in C4 contests prior to October 5, 2022 and have not previously registered your username via wallet authentication, you must register your account.

## Authenticate with your wallet

You can authenticate with your wallet using either MetaMask or WalletConnect and submit findings without re-entering the same info over and over. After you register you can have the option to log in with either your wallet or your username and password.

If you have and existing Code4rena username, you can re-register your warden handle at https://code4rena.com/ by connecting your wallet from the "connect" dropdown.

## Authenticate with username and password

If you're a new warden, you can choose to sign up with a username and password only. **If you choose this option, you won't be able to link a wallet to your account for authentication purposes later.**

## How to connect your wallet and submit findings

- Go to https://code4rena.com/ and hover over the “connect” dropdown.
- Choose whether to connect with MetaMask or WalletConnect, or sign up with just a username and password.
- If you were a registered warden and submitted valid findings before May 25, 2022, you need to connect your wallet. Make sure to connect with an address you’ve used previously to receive earnings from code4rena contests prior to May 25, 2022.
- Follow the prompts to connect your C4 username with your wallet.
- Check your email for further instructions.

## Once your request to connect your wallet is complete and approved:

- Sign in with the same method you used to register.
- Proceed to the contest of your choice and submit a finding as usual.

## Teams

Once individual team members are authenticated, they will be able to submit findings as individuals or on behalf of the team.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### **If you were a registered warden prior to June 28, 2022 and you see this error when you fill out the registration form:**

`[your handle] is already a registered username`

If you submitted valid findings before May 25, 2022, please choose either MetaMask or WalletConnect from the "connect" dropdown.

1. If you did that and ended up on the registration page, please make sure you connect with a wallet address you’ve used for a Code4rena contest prior to May 25, 2022.
2. If that doesn’t work, please [submit a Help Desk request](https://code4rena.com/help/).

### **If your registration was merged but you still can't log in:**

If you registered with a wallet, make sure you are authenticating with the same address you used when you registered.

If that doesn’t work, please [submit a Help Desk request](https://code4rena.com/help/).

### **If you previously submitted findings, but your wallet is not supported by WalletConnect:**

The best solution here is for you to import your wallet to either MetaMask, or another wallet app that is supported by WalletConnect.

If you can’t do that, then [submit a Help Desk request](https://code4rena.com/help/) and C4 staff will help you get your account registered.

### **Can I change the wallet address where I receive awards?**

You can change your payment information any time. Simply log in and go to [your account management page](https://code4rena.com/account).

Note: for each contest, C4 distributes awards to the payment address on file *at the time of award calculation*.

### **Can I change the wallet address I log in with?**

Unfortunately due to some restrictions in Moralis, changing addresses is not currently supported as well as we’d like it to be in the future. There is one exception: if you use MetaMask, you can link multiple addresses to your C4 account.

However, **it’s critical that you do not try to log in with the new address that you want to link before you link it.** Attempting to connect while signed in to the new MetaMask address you want to connect will create a new user object. That new user object will block your ability to associate that address with your C4 account. Please watch the video below for details.

To link multiple addresses in MetaMask, please follow the instructions in this video:

### **Can I change my login method after I register?**

If you registered with your wallet, you can have the option to log in with either your wallet or your username and password.

If you registered prior to October 5, 2022, you can set your password by going to your [account management page](https://code4rena.com/account) and clicking on the "reset password" button. This will send you an email with a password reset link. After you set your password, you can log in with your c4 username and password immediately.

If you registered with only a password and not a wallet, you will only be able to log in with your username and password.

### **What if my wallet was hacked?**

Please follow these steps:

1. If you are not logged in and you haven't set up your password yet, click "Log in" from the connect dropdown and then click "forgot password" to get a password reset link
2. Log in with your username and password
3. Update your payment addresses from the account page
4. Submit a help request through our [Help Desk](https://code4rena.com/help/) while logged in so that we can remove the hacked wallet from your account.
