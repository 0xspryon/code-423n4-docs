# Hire a C4 warden for a solo audit 

[Certified Wardens](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/certified-contributors) have the opportunity to book solo audits through Code4rena, via the “Available for hire” function in their website profiles. These audits are performed by one warden who reviews the sponsor’s code and produces a report. ([Here’s an example](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-07-canto/) of a solo audit performed by a Code4rena warden.)

- The process of booking a solo audit begins with a project team member clicking the “Get a quote” button on a warden’s profile, and sharing scoping details with the Code4rena team.
- Code4rena staff will then consult with the warden and project team to firm up scoping, pricing, and dates.

## Benefits to projects and wardens

- When a solo audit is booked via a warden’s “Available for hire” function, both the warden and the project have direct access to Code4rena staff for assistance with:
    - Legal agreements
    - Scoping, pricing, and logistical planning
    - Collection and disbursement of funds
    - External accountability via a Code4rena Judge
- This top-tier support you’ll receive from the Code4rena team is built into the solo audit booking model, at only 20% of the total audit fee.

## How can I opt in to solo audits?

If you are a Certified warden, you can make yourself available for solo audits by logging in to your [user account on the Code4rena website](https://code4rena.com/account/edit-profile), and opting in to the “Available for hire” function on the Settings screen.
