# Wardens

C4 contests let people of a wide range of skill levels get rewarded while showcasing their talent in order to make the DeFi ecosystem more secure.

✨Stay up to date with new contests by [following C4 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/code423n4) and joining our [community Discord](https://discord.gg/EY5dvm3evD).

### Joining a contest

Anyone can apply to participate in a contest. [Apply using this form](https://code4rena.com/register/), then pop into Discord and give us a howl in `#`[`i-want-to-be-a-warden`](https://discord.gg/pmGC2gH9Mg).

Once you've completed those steps and been approved, [have a look at the C4 website](https://code4rena.com), where you'll find a list of open and upcoming contests, along with their pot size, start and end date, and other relevant information. Active contests will typically include a link to the code repo, as well as the submission form for findings.

As a reminder, for Wardens participating in code contests, please familiarize yourself with the [submission policy](submission-policy.md) and [judging criteria](/awarding/judging-criteria/README.md) prior to participating.

### Registering a team

To register a team, you must first register your individual warden handles, and then register your team [here](https://code4rena.com/register-team/).  

Once a team is created, you have the ability to add/remove members and update your payment address while logged in as your team.  

Any team updates will create a pull request and a related help desk ticket for the C4 staff to review and approve.  Please allow 24-48 business hours for that process to complete.

❗️**Important note: Team awards are sent as a single payment to *one* wallet.** We strongly recommend using a multisig wallet, or a tool like [PaymentSplitter](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/finance/PaymentSplitter.sol), to distribute awards among your team members. Note that C4 does not track which team member submitted each finding; your team is responsible for keeping track of that information, and distributing awards. The team structure at C4 is designed so that you submit as a team and get paid as a team.


### Contest timeline

* **Most contests run for 3-7 days,** and typically start and end at 20:00 UTC.
* The rest of our contest timeline is documented on the [Contest timeline](../../structure/our-process/) page.

### Questions?

When contest sponsors come to Code4rena for an audit, we always encourage them to provide documentation, and to make themselves available for questions, so they get the most out of their audit.

When a sponsor designates a team member who is available for questions, that person will introduce themselves in the C4 Discord (in a contest-specific channel), and we recommend contacting them via DM with any questions you may have.

### ⏩ TL;DR

* Turn in your reports before the contest end time.
* For each contest, submit your Medium and High risk findings individually.
* Bundle all of your low-risk and non-critical findings into a *single* QA report. 
* Similarly, list *all* of your gas optimizations together in a single Gas report.
* Be sure to [register your handle and Polygon address](https://code4rena.com/register/) to receive your share.
* Publicly disclosing any discovered bugs or vulnerabilities is grounds for disqualification from all C4 events.
