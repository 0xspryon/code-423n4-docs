# Sponsors

## Sponsoring an audit

Any project can submit a request to sponsor a C4 audit. Just [complete this form](https://code4rena.typeform.com/i-want-an-audit) and we will reach out to set up a meeting or send over a scoping questionnaire to get the ball rolling.

One of our team members will review your repo, assess your responses and contracts, and recommend which audit package would be appropriate for your scope. 

**If you decide to move ahead with an audit, all relevant code will be made public at the time of your audit in most cases.** We also offer KYC and private competitions if privacy is a need; just let our team know.  

### **Determining pot size**

We work together with you as the sponsor to set the appropriate award pool amount for your audit pool at or above current audit floor prices. To attract warden participation in the highly competitive engineering market, we work with standard award pool sizes. We regularly evaluate and adjust audit pricing to ensure incentive alignment with wardens. Sponsors always have the option of providing a larger-than-floor pot size, which tends to attract more warden talent and attention.

### **Gas optimization pool**

By default, 2.5% of the award pool is allocated to valid gas optimizations. We encourage all sponsors to keep this in place, as we can help each other be conscious of ways to minimize gas fees for users -- and indeed some sponsors may which to allocate a higher percentage of the award pool to this purpose. 

Some projects may not wish to create a separate incentive for gas optimizations, and removing it should be discussed with Code4rena staff during the pre-audit setup phase.

### **Org fee**

There is a fee on top of the determined audit pool, which goes to the Code4rena DAO to cover the costs associated with organizing, promoting, and reporting on audits.

### **Audit scheduling**

Our standard, one-week audits start and end on weekdays at 20:00:00 UTC. Due to high demand, we only lock audits into the schedule after receiving a deposit for the audit; we are unable to make scheduling commitments otherwise.

Note that in order to provide your team with the most efficient and effective code review, we require your team to add ALL code, documentation, and notes to your audit repo at least 48 hours prior to your audit start time.
