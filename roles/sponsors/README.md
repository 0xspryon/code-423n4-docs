# Sponsors

## Sponsoring a contest

Any project can submit a request to sponsor a C4 Contest. Just reach out in the **#i-want-to-be-a-sponsor** channel in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/EY5dvm3evD) and we will reach out to set up a meeting or send a few scoping questions to get the ball rolling.

One of our team members will review this repo and assess your responses and contracts and recommend which of our contests would be appropriate for your scope. **If you decide to move ahead with a contest, this repo will be made public at the time of a contest.**

### **Determining pot size**

We work together with you as the sponsor to set the appropriate award pool amount for your contest pool at or above current contest floor prices based on your scope.&#x20;

To attract warden participation in the highly competitive market, we regularly evaluate and adjust contest pricing to ensure incentive alignment with wardens. Sponsors always have the option of providing a larger-than-floor pot size, which tends to attract more warden talent and attention.

### **Gas optimization pool**

By default, 5% of the award pool is allocated to valid gas optimizations. We encourage each contest to keep this in place, as we can help each other be conscious of ways to minimize gas fees for users, and indeed some sponsors may which to allocate a higher percentage of the award pool to this purpose. Some projects may not wish to create a separate incentive for gas optimizations, and removing it should be discussed with the organizers prior to agreeing to move forward with a contest.

### **Org fee**

There is a fee on top of the determined contest pool, which goes to the Code4rena DAO to cover the costs associated with organizing, promoting, and creating reports for contests.

### **Contest scheduling**

We lock contests in to the schedule contests after receiving a deposit for the contest. We are unable to make scheduling commitments otherwise.
