# Sponsors

## Sponsoring a contest

Any project can submit a request to sponsor a C4 Contest. Just reach out in the **#i-want-to-be-a-sponsor** channel in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/EY5dvm3evD) and we will create a private GitHub repo for you to share your current smart contracts and answer a few questions about the scope you’d like wardens to focus on.

One of our team members will review this repo and assess your responses and contracts and suggest a minimum pot size. **If you decide to move ahead with a contest, this repo will be made public at the time of a contest.**

### **Determining pot size**

As a sponsor, you are responsible for setting the amount of your contest pool (above our suggested minimum), knowing that a larger pot size will attract more warden talent and more attention. Pots thus far have tended to run between $40k and $100k USDC. We are seeing greater warden attention in $100k+ contests.

### **Gas optimization pool**

Many contests create a separate pool for finding gas optimizations. Previous sponsors have used a fifth or tenth of the total pot for this reward. Some projects do not wish to create a separate incentive for gas optimizations. Code 423n4 lets each project decide whether to create this pool.

### **Org fee**

There is a 20% fee on top of the determined contest pool, which goes to the C4 org to cover the costs of reporting and organizing contests.

### **Sponsor tokens**

Sponsors are free to ‘sweeten the pot’ with their own token _on top of_ the core contest pool (stablecoin / Eth). There is a 40% fee on sponsor tokens.

### **Contest scheduling**

Contests start Wednesday 00:00:00 UTC and end Tuesday 23:59 UTC. We schedule contests after reviewing the codebase, providing a suggested minimum, and receiving contest funding. Due to high demand, we cannot make any scheduling guarantees until these steps have been completed, and once a contest has been scheduled, we are unable to move it on our calendar.
