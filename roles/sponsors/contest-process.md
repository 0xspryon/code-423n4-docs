# Contest process

### Before the contest

* If you haven’t already, join the [C4 Discord](https://discord.gg/YgBwyreF9B) server and let us know you’re interested in sponsoring a contest in the `#i-want-to-be-a-sponsor` channel.
* We'll create a private GitHub repo for you to share your current smart contracts and answer a few questions about the scope you’d like wardens to focus on. If you decide to move ahead with a contest, **this repo will be made public** at the time of a contest.
* After your code has been reviewed, a C4 Gardener will contact you to iron out the details.
* Once we’ve received a deposit, we will finalize scheduling and begin to promote the contest.

### During the contest

* You will be able to see issues as they are submitted to the contest’s private repo, but note that >90% of contest findings tend to get submitted in the last day, so don’t be concerned if findings seem slow to come in.
* We ask for a member or members of your engineering team to be available in the C4 discord in order to answer wardens’ questions via DM.
* Please avoid discussing any issues submitted by wardens in an open channel, as this could give hints to other wardens.

### After the contest

Your work will play a role in developing a public report of the contest audit.

* Sponsors review findings, identify duplicates, and provide comments as you confirm, acknowledge, or dispute wardens’ findings (use labels for this).
* As your team works to mitigate issues, most sponsors will create a PR for each issue addressed in your codebase and link to it in the C4 finding issue and label the finding as resolved.
