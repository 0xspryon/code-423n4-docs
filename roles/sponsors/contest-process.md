# Audit process

### Before the audit

* If you havenâ€™t already, join the [C4 Discord](https://discord.gg/YgBwyreF9B) server and let us know youâ€™re interested in sponsoring an audit in the `#ðŸ’¼i-want-c4-to-audit-our-code` channel.
* We'll ask you to share your current smart contracts and answer a few questions about the scope youâ€™d like wardens to focus on. If you decide to move ahead with an audit, **the relevant code will be made public** at the time of your audit.
* After your code has been reviewed, Code4rena staff will contact you to iron out the details.
* Once weâ€™ve received a deposit, we will finalize scheduling and begin to promote the audit.

### During the audit

* Be prepared for a **code freeze for the duration of the audit** â€” important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)
* We ask for a member or members of your engineering team to be available in the C4 Discord server in order to answer wardensâ€™ questions via DM.
* Please avoid discussing any issues submitted by wardens in an open channel, as this could give hints to other wardens.

### After the audit

Your work will play a role in developing a public report of the audit.

* Sponsors review findings, help identify duplicates, and provide comments as you confirm, acknowledge, or dispute wardensâ€™ findings.
* As your team works to mitigate issues, most sponsors will create a PR for each issue addressed in your codebase and link to it in the C4 finding issue and label the finding as resolved.
