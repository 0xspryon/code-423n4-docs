# Audit process

### Before the audit

* If you havenâ€™t already, join the [C4 Discord](https://discord.gg/YgBwyreF9B) server and let us know youâ€™re interested in sponsoring an audit in the `#ðŸ’¼i-want-c4-to-audit-our-code` channel.
* We'll ask you to share your current smart contracts and answer a few questions about the scope youâ€™d like wardens to focus on. If you decide to move ahead with an audit, **the relevant code will be made public** at the time of your audit.
* After your code has been reviewed, Code4rena staff will contact you to iron out the details.
* Once weâ€™ve received a deposit, we will finalize scheduling and begin to promote the audit.
* In order to launch your audit on schedule, your audit repo (including the `README`) must be completely set up and shared with us at least 48 business hours (2 business days) before your audit is scheduled to start. This ensures we have time to review it and help you finalize any last-minute details.

### During the audit

* Be prepared for a **code freeze for the duration of the audit** â€” critical because it maintains a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)
* We ask for a member or members of your engineering team to be available in the C4 Discord server in order to answer wardensâ€™ questions via DM.
* Please avoid discussing any issues submitted by wardens in an open channel, as this could give hints to other wardens.

### After the audit

Your work will play a role in developing a public report of the audit.

* Sponsors review findings, help identify duplicates, and provide comments as you confirm, acknowledge, or dispute wardensâ€™ findings.
* As your team works to mitigate issues, most sponsors will create a PR for each issue addressed in your codebase and link to it in the C4 finding issue and label the finding as resolved.
