# Contest timeline

We are working on tightening up all of our processes in order to be able to distribute awards and publish reports more quickly. Here's our estimated timeline:

|  | Ideal | Actual (on average) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contest finishes | Day 1 | Day 1 |
| Sponsors review and give feedback on findings | Day 5 | Day 14 |
| Judges determine final severity | Day 7 | Day 21-30 |
| Judging QA complete; awards announced | Day 9 | Day 25-34 |
| Awards are distributed; Sponsors complete mitigation of any issues | Day 14 | Day 32-44 |
| Audit report is published; Contest issues are made public | Day 21 | Day 42-60 |

Presently, the process takes us longer than the ideal, but we are actively working to improve our planning and processes that will smooth out the rough spots that slow things down.
