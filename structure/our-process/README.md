# Contest timeline

We are working on tightening up all of our processes in order to be able to distribute awards and publish reports more quickly. Here is our ideal timeline:

* Wednesday
  * Contest finishes
* By Monday after the contest
  * Sponsors review and give feedback on findings
* By Wednesday one week after contest ends
  * Judges determine final severity
  * Awards are announced
* By Friday one week after contest ends
  * Awards are distributed
  * Sponsors complete mitigation of any issues
* By Wednesday two weeks after contest ends
  * Audit report is published
  * Contest issues are made public

Presently, the process takes us longer than this timeline, but we are actively working to improve our planning and processes that will smooth out the rough spots that slow things down.
