# Code4rena

The players in the arena:

* [**Wardens**](roles/wardens/) protect the DeFi ecosystem from threats by auditing code.
* [**Sponsors**](roles/sponsors/) create prize pools to attract wardens to audit their project.
* [**Judges**](roles/judges/) decide the severity, validity, and quality of findings and rate the performance of wardens.

C4 audit contests are different from both bug bounties and traditional audits.

### Bug bounties vs C4 audit contests

| Bug bounties                                                                                            | Audit contests                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spec work.** No way to have confidence that the time invested will produce a payout.                  | **Guaranteed payouts.** Auditors know it’s highly likely they can find a bug that will make it worth their time.                                  |
| **Dark forest.** Who knows how much competition there is right now? Or how mature the codebase is?      | **Low-hanging fruit.** If a project is seeking an audit, it’s likely fresh code with clear opportunities to dig in.                               |
| **Grow on your own.** Researchers have to proactively look for ways to learn and level up their skills. | **Learning community.** Open contests let auditors compare everyone’s findings and learn new things every single week.                            |
| **Paradox of choice.** So many projects have bounties. How does an auditor choose which to focus on?    | **Less FOMO.** C4 runs a handful of active contests at a time and wardens can RSVP to signal to each other which contests have more participants. |

### Traditional audits vs C4 audit contests

| Traditional audits                                                                                                     | C4 audit contests                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constrained time.** If you want a quality audit from a top firm, you’re going to have to wait.                       | **Time flexible.** Code contests can be put together quickly for teams eager to go to market.                             |
| **Constrained cost.** Audit firms must recruit and retain talent, and defensively maintain their brand.                | **Flexible cost.** C4 scales to meet demand. Sponsors can increase pot size to attract more attention.                    |
| **Constrained diversity.** Audit firm staff have to work to stay ahead of DeFi's complex and expanding attack surface. | **Diverse capability.** C4 contests allow specialized security researchers to demonstrate their skill and creativity.     |
| **Systematic.** Firms use set processes for evaluating code, which differs from the way attackers approach things.     | **Rigorous.** C4 wardens are incentivized to work creatively to find as many rare, high risk vulnerabilities as possible. |
